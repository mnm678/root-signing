# Signer manual for Sigstore root-signing

## One-time setup for new signers

### Yubikey configuration

Generate a PIV Digital Signature key on your hardware key if you don't have one yet.

Using [Yubikey Manager](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/)
this is possible in _Applications -> PIV -> Configure certificates -> Digital signature_.
Another option is `cosign piv-tool`.

### Software install

* Install tuf-on-ci-sign
  ```
  # this example uses a virtualenv: feel free to install tuf-on-ci-sign elsewhere
  python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/tuf-on-ci-sign
  source ~/.venvs/tuf-on-ci-sign/bin/activate
  pip install tuf-on-ci-sign

  # If you are on MacOS and the install fails, you can try
  #   brew install swig
  ```
* Install Yubicos PKCS#11 module
  * on Debian `sudo apt install ykcs11`
  * on MacOS `brew install yubico-piv-tool`

### Repository setup

* Fork the repository on github: https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing/fork
* clone your fork and add the upstream as a remote:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USER-NAME>/root-signing.git
  cd root-signing
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing.git
  ```
* Create `.tuf-on-ci-sign.ini` with this content:
  ```
  [settings]
  user-name = @<YOUR-GITHUB-USER-NAME>
  push-remote = origin
  pull-remote = upstream
  ```
  If you used an already existing checkout, please make sure the remote names make sense: `push-remote`
  should be your fork, `pull-remote` should be the upstream root-signing repository.

### Smoke test

In your root-signing directory, try to sign in a non-existent signing event:
```bash
$ tuf-on-ci-sign sign/just-testing
Remote branch not found: branching off from main
Signing event sign/just-testing (commit xxxxxxx)
Nothing to do.
$
```

This verifies that `tuf-on-ci-sign` should be ready for signing.

## Signing

When a signing event asks you to sign or to accept an invite:
* Read the signing event PR comments to find out the purpose and content of this signing event
* If the artifacts in `targets/` (such as `targets/trusted_root.json`) are modified, verify
  that the proposed changes are sensible
* Change into `root-signing` directory
* Enter your virtualenv if you use one: `source ~/.venvs/tuf-on-ci-sign/bin/activate`
* Run signing tool: `tuf-on-ci-sign <SIGNING-EVENT>`
  * if you are accepting an invite, choose "Yubikey" as your key type
  * if you are signing, review the changes (if needed, use GitHub UI or another terminal to see the signing event branch content)
  * Signing automatically commits the signature and pushes it to a branch on your fork
* After signing, click the provided link to create a PR to the signing event branch
